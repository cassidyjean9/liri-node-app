# liri-node-app

This is a command line interface that uses the BandsInTown API, the Spotify API, and the omdb API to allow users to search for upcoming concerts, musical artists, and songs. Users can enter "concert-this" and an artist to get info about a concert, "spotify-this-song" to get info about a song, and "movie-this" to get info about a movie. "do-what-it-says" also searches for the song in the .txt file.

The technologies used are node, javascript, axios, different APIs, and moment.
